# Data-Science-Data-Analyst-Task
This is a research proposal to recruit fit-for-purpose social workers after being trained on social work and took several diploma courses on social work
Imagine we take graduates out of the university who are high performers into children's
social work, they are recruited by a Client.
They spend the first 12 months doing a PGD in Social Care in partnership with different
Universities where they spend time with different local authorities to get experience to
understand if they like the experience and would like to carry on.
The Clients will pay them a bursary throughout the period to encourage them to pursue it
as an opportunity. After that year, the client places them with local authorities suitable for
them so it matches their background and where they live.
How it’s done now in the current scheme is that they are randomly placed and asked to
carry on. Clients want to tailor the right people to the right areas (local authorities).
Help children by introducing the right people to their communities and attracting the right
people so they understand the children's background.
Now the recruitment is not good so we want to understand who makes a good social
worker and why do they stick and what makes them work.
As they finish PGD and get placed with local authorities, clients will pay grant payment
for the first year to local authorities to subsidise wages. After the year we stop paying for
grants and expect them to stick.
Strong KPIs: except someone sticks after grant payment is stopped, client don't hit our
metrics and don’t get our KPIs.
Solution: Client needs to find people who will be good social workers and get them
through the 3-year programme without leaving.
There will be a Learning portal that will sit around the higher edu portal that delivers the
training.
Allow them to communicate to people in their cohort
Pull data from university, how they are performing in their courses and how they’ve done
in their placement
Local authority data when placed permanently. We don’t know what huge amount of data we will get.
